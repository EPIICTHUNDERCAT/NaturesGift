# This is an example of an animation with a pause in it.
# The first frame (Index 0) is displayed for 2 seconds.
# The speed of the rest of the animation is set to 2 (1/10 second).

# You can replace any number in the frame lineup with this code: { "index": 0, "time": 40 }
# In this example only the first frame has special timing, but it can be any frame.

# The "index" is the frame number (starting with 0 at the top.
# The "time" is the number of ticks (1/20 second incriments) that frame is displayed for.
